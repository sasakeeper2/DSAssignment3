'''Why is a stack the right choice for undo/redo?: Stack is the right choice for undo/redo because it follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. 
This means that the most recent action performed by the user is the first one to be undone. 
When a user performs an action, it is pushed onto the undo stack. 
If they decide to undo that action, it is popped from the stack and reversed. 
If they then want to redo that action, it can be pushed onto a redo stack and popped from there when needed.
This structure allows for easy tracking of actions in the order they were performed and ensures that the most recent actions are addressed first.

Why is a queue better suited for the help desk?: A queue is better suited for the help desk because it follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. 
This means that the first customer to arrive at the help desk is the first one to be served.

How do your implementations differ from Pythonâ€™s built-in lists?: They give each Object a node that can be tracked much more easily and efficiently. '''
